# 16n website

We need a website, fast, if only to answer the question _what is this thing
I have seen on the internet?_ Ta-da!	

## Updating the editor

From the website directory, on your own machine, run

    ./update_editor.sh

This will checkout the latest version of the editor, build it, and stick it in
the `/editor` subdirectory. You will need `git` and `pnpm` installed for this to
work.
