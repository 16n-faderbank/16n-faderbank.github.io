## What is that thing?

This is 16n. It is a bank of 16 faders. It is designed for controlling electronic musical instruments and devices.

## What does it do?

You move faders on it. It emits output. 

It has a number of outputs:
* it sends MIDI data over USB; by default, a different continuous controller for each fader.
* it sends MIDI data over a 3.5mm stereo (TRS) jack, which you can break out using  any available converter. There is a switch to toggle between the two standards for this (so itâ€™ll work with both Korg/Makenoise and Arturia/Novation products and converters directly). This can be the same CCs as the MIDI over USB, or different ones, if youâ€™d like.
* it sends 0-5V CV out of sixteen jacks, one for each fader. (Well, almost 5V, dependent on your USB power supply)
* it sends data over I2C, using a TRS jack: either as a master device, which could connect directly to (e.g.) an ER-301 or monome Ansible, or as a bus device for a monome Teletype

All outputs are sent **simultaneously**.

16n is built around a Teensy microcontroller, and is written in Arduino-style C++; you can edit it all through the Arduino IDE. You can easily configure options via a config file, or write your own firmware, if you prefer.

16n is open source: the code is MIT licensed; the hardware is Creative Commons

## How do I get one?

Everything you need to make one can be found at [the github repository](TODO).

That contains schematics files, Gerber files, original EAGLE cad documents, CAD files for top/bottom panels, and the firmware code. It contains links to BOMs and a concise build guide.

If that sounds like gibberish to you, you might want to try to find a friendly music-DIY type to build one for you. Right now, the only way to get a 16n is to make it yourself.

## How much does it cost?

The bill of materials varies depending on how many you're making at once. The circuit boards work out at around \$240 for 3 from OSHPark, but can go down to around \$50 for 5 from Chinese manufacturers. Including plastic panels, fader caps, and so on, you should be able to build one for under $200.

## Can you give me some examples of what people are doing with it?

Yes.

## Who's making this?

So far: Brian Crabtree, Sean Hellfritsch, Tom Armitage, Brendon Cassidy.

This is a community project that emerges from the [Lines](https://llllllll.co) forum. [Brian Crabtree](https://nnnnnnnn.co) and [Sean Hellfritsch](http://coolmaritime.org) made the first version. [Tom Armitage](https://tomarmitage.com) redesigned the electronics, primarily adding CV and MIDI outs; Tom and [Brendon Cassidy](http://bpcmusic.com) extended the firmware; Brendon's contributions to the I2C code must be noted in particular.

## Where can I find out more?

There's not a mailing list or anything. There is, however, [this sprawling thread on lines](https://llllllll.co/t/interest-check-faderbank-run/9920), where you can follow the story so far.
