## What is that thing?

This is 16n. It is a bank of 16 faders. It is designed for controlling electronic musical instruments and devices.

## What does it do?

You move faders on it. It emits output. 

It has a number of outputs:
* it sends MIDI data over USB; by default, a different continuous controller for each fader.
* it sends MIDI data over a 3.5mm stereo (TRS) jack, which you can break out using  any available converter. There is a switch to toggle between the two standards for this (so itâ€™ll work with both Korg/Makenoise and Arturia/Novation products and converters directly). This can be the same CCs as the MIDI over USB, or different ones, if youâ€™d like.
* it sends 0-5V CV out of sixteen jacks, one for each fader.
* it sends data over I2C, using a TRS jack: either as a master device, which could connect directly to (e.g.) an ER-301, or as a bus device for a monomer Teletype

All outputs are sent **simultaneously**.

16n is built around a Teensy microcontroller. Youâ€™ll be able to customise the software yourself, if youâ€™d like.

16n will eventually be open source: code, schematics, etc.

## How do I get one?

16n is not finished yet.

When itâ€™s ready, the plan is that youâ€™ll be able to buy a built 16n. Itâ€™ll be totally assembled and ready to use, with all the firmware installed. It will have an aluminium top and bottom, and be a hair smaller than the prototypes you may have seen. This is likely - but not for sure - to be a limited run.

Once the open-source files are available, you could also build your own if you wanted - or make your own modifications.

## But I have seen it on the internet, on somebody's Instagram or similar?

You may well have done. A few people - Tom, Sean, Brendon, and some friends and colleagues - have prototypes. The versions they are using are very much prototypes. The final version may not look the same or be made of the same materials.

## How much is it going to be?

We don't know yet. We have an idea, but we're not going to share a price until we know it's the price you'll pay.

## Can you give me some examples of what people are doing with it?

Yes.

## Who's making this?

So far: Brian Crabtree, Sean Hellfritsch, Tom Armitage, Brendon Cassidy.

This is a community project that emerges from the [Lines](https://llllllll.co) forum. [Brian Crabtree](https://nnnnnnnn.co) and [Sean Hellfritsch](http://coolmaritime.org) made the first version. [Tom Armitage](https://tomarmitage.com) redesigned the electronics, primarily adding CV and MIDI outs; Tom and [Brendon Cassidy](http://bpcmusic.com) extended the firmware; Brendon's contributions to the I2C code must be noted in particular.

## Where can I find out more?

There's not a mailing list or anything yet. There is, however, [this sprawling thread on lines](https://llllllll.co/t/interest-check-faderbank-run/9920), where you can follow the story so far.
